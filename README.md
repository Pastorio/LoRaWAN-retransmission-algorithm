## Introduction
This project is based on the research conducted by João Pedro Pastório as part of his thesis at the Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná. The thesis focuses on developing an algorithm to enhance the performance of retransmissions in LoRaWAN networks. The algorithm operates at the application level and aims to optimize the retransmission process.

## Implementation
The implementation of the algorithm is available in this repository. It includes the necessary code and instructions to integrate the algorithm into existing LoRaWAN applications. The code is written in [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) and can be easily adapted to different hardware platforms.

## Benefits
The implementation of the application-level retransmission management algorithm offers several benefits, including:
- Improved reliability of data transmission in LoRaWAN networks
- Reduced network congestion and improved overall network performance
- Enhanced energy efficiency by minimizing unnecessary retransmissions
- Increased scalability and capacity of LoRaWAN networks

## Usage
To use the algorithm in your LoRaWAN application, follow the instructions provided in the [Implementation](#implementation) section. Make sure you have the necessary hardware and software requirements. The code is well-documented and includes examples to help you integrate the algorithm into your project.
